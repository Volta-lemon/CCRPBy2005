On the upper front of the jacket and above the dragon, two pomegranates are depicted. Pomegranate, with its many seeds, is a symbol of fertility. Many other auspicious motifs, including clouds, symbol of good fortune, and bats, symbol of happiness, surround the dragon and two phoenixes.   purchased by the Indianapolis Museum of Art (1906).

Famous for his rapid technique, Chase claimed he could return at least one fish to market fresh enough to be sold.   William Merritt Chase: Celebrated Still Life Painter ""William Merritt Chase was a versatile painter of landscapes, portraits, and still lifes. In fact, he was widely esteemed as the foremost American still-life painter of his era. Born in Nineveh, Indiana, Chase spent a short period as a pupil of Barton Stone Hays, an Indianapolis portrait painter. He continued his studies in New York at the National Academy. Later, he traveled extensively in Europe after studying in Munich. In 1878, he returned to New York, where he made his home. He exerted great influence upon the younger American painters through his teaching. Although his approach was realistic, he invested everything with a particular life and charm.In 1904, Chase began a series of fish subjects, which was highly acclaimed. This canvas is a spirited example of the genre. There can be little doubt that Chase had seen similar still lifes by the French artist Édouard Manet from the mid-1860s. This broadly painted and carefully balanced composition of shiny fish set against a dark, contrasting background hearkens back to Chase's training in Munich during the 1870s. The painting was one of the artist's favorites. In a letter of 1915 to the IMA (then known as the Art Association of Indianapolis), Chase wrote, “…I am pleased to know that you care for my fish picture. I feel sure this is the best one I have painted, and I would be much pleased to have it permanently in the Art Association.""Pisano, Ronald.

Two pairs of phoenixes, representing the union of male and female, are featured prominently on the upper front of the jacket. A variety of paired fowl are embroidered throughout the jacket and skirt.

Monks and pilgrims from lands as distant as China and Burma came there to study. Buddhist art of this period first flourished in Magadha, the homeland of Sakyamuni in southern Bihar, and gradually art production centers arose further eastward. A huge corpus of sculpture survives from the period. Most common are stelae like this example, which may have been made for placement in a decorative niche on a building or as the main object of worship in a shrine. The mudra (gesture) is called dharma-chakra (Wheel of the Law) and signifies the Buddha's teaching of the path to enlightenment.   Mr. and Mrs. Charles B.

Wine containers were the first bronze vessels made in China and are the most plentiful among the early bronzes. The use of legs on the pouring vessels suggests that the wine was heated over a fire. Tripod bowls, or ding vessels The tripod bowl, with three legs for support over a fire, is very practical. It is perhaps the most important type of container throughout the history of Chinese ceremonies. The decoration on round vessels was generally designed in three segments, following the main mold segments. Ancestral dedications written in an early script can often be found in the interior walls of the vessel. Ceramic substitutes Ceramic or clay vessels were used in funerals by people who could not afford, or did not have access to, the more valuable bronze material.

Yet the secret of its manufacture eluded them until 1709, when Johann Friedrich Böttger, an alchemist indentured to Augustus the Strong, elector of Saxony and king of Poland, created a highly glazed, translucent white porcelain. Böttger yearned for his freedom, but his discovery was so important that it was an affair of state and, much to his chagrin, he was appointed the first director of the Meissen Porcelain Manufactory-the first in Europe to produce hard-paste porcelain objects.The IMA's plate dates to the early years of the Meissen operation, when its most beautiful works were those decorated in enamels under the direction of Johann Gregor Herold, or Höroldt, who was in charge of the painting department until his retirement in 1765. Among other surface ornamentation, Herold introduced chinoiserie, the decorative motifs based, as the name suggests, on Chinese and other Asian themes, for which Meissen became famous. The IMA's plate, decorated with chinoiserie elements in the center and European landscape and harbor scenes around its rim, is associated with the work of Christian Friedrich Herold, or Höroldt, one of the major artists at the manufactory and possibly a cousin of Johann Gregor. The reverse of the plate displays Meissen's trademark crossed swords in underglaze blue.[I]n one sense [Böttger] made gold, because the great [sales] of that ware bring a great deal of money into the country.-Baron Carl Ludwig Von Poellnitz, 1737   Arthur Kauffman, Frankfort am Main, Germany and London, England; (Rosenberg & Stiebel, Inc., New York New York); purchased by the Indianapolis Museum of Art at Newfields in 1988.

Thereafter, the process was restricted to those photographers who were sufficiently intrigued by the beauty and permanence of the platinum print to produce their own paper.  Conner’s view at Huangshan (Yellow Mountain), taken during the first of her many trips to China, makes expert use of the platinum process to preserve the tonal nuances of this peculiar granite formation and its clinging pines softly enveloped in heavy atmosphere.  For centuries, Huangshan was a favorite subject for Chinese scroll painters, and, in homage to them, Conner used an unwieldy 7-by-17-inch banquet camera to create her scroll-formatted photograph.

This method of recycling ritual bronzes has been generally condemned because it destroys items from the past. The translated inscription inside the neck reads: Zeng Boji used auspicious metal from old vessels and he made this pot for ritual wine for entertaining guests. May his virtue be without flaw, thereby being filial, thereby feasting [his ancestors], and thereby being given long life. May his descendants thereby receive limitless great blessings.   Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection (2005) The forty-one-character inscription inside the neck of this container—there is an identical one on a similar vessel in the Palace Museum, Taipei—is famous for being the first to mention the recycling of earlier bronzes in order to make other vessels. The older bronzes were melted down at the behest of Yi, a nobleman who lived in south central China, near today's Wuhan in Hubei province. The inscription in the container continues, explaining that Yi's vessel held “ritual wine for entertaining guests. May his virtue be without flaw; thereby being filial, thereby feasting [ancestors], and thereby being given long life. May his descendants thereby receive limitless great blessings.” The “wine” was a grain-based alcoholic beverage.The style of their bronzes shows that the people of the Zhou dynasty modified many of the traditions they inherited from Shang artisans. Where Shang containers are often elegant in shape, Zhou vessels become more squat and massive while the bold, animal-based decoration of the earlier objects gradually yields to designs of a more abstract and fluid nature, like the wavy grooves that encircle this container. The numerous creatures of earlier times are here reduced to two: a small head holding a ring on either side of the neck.Yi, the earl of Zeng, used auspicious metal from old vessels and he made this pot. . . .—Inscription, about 800 BCE   Probably (Anthony Carter, Ltd., London). {1} (Weisbrod Chinese Art, New York); {2} purchased by the Indianapolis Museum of Art in 1994 (1994.80). {3}{1} In the IMA Historical File a note indicates that this object was acquired from Anthony Carter, Ltd., London.
