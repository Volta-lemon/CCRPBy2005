6,Sitting Monkey,China,2nd-1st century BCE,"This rare wood monkey was created as a mingqi (ming-chee), an object made specifically for a burial chamber. It was carved for a tomb in the state of Chu in southern China where wood was more prevalent – mingqi in the north of China were usually baked clay since wood was scarce. These wood figures were almost always coated with thin layers of lacquer, a resin extracted from a lacquer tree (gishu). The addition of lacquer to a wood sculpture made it highly resistant to insects and water, thus preserving this object for more than two thousand years.",http://emuseum.toledomuseum.org/internal/media/dispatcher/64960/preview,http://emuseum.toledomuseum.org/objects/60070/sitting-monkey?ctx=441fc1a9-66c1-4712-bb77-e675df8e016c&idx=47
