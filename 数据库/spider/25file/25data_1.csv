Noticing how little the lead glaze ran reveals the superior control of the firing process. The bull gives scale to the size of this powerful figure and suggests a derivation from the Buddhist guardian of the south, which was the preferred direction for doors, whether imperial or tomb.   Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection (2005) This figure's alert, defensive posture expresses great energy. His raised left hand would have grasped a lance or pike. Though his fierce face looks rather naturalistic, the curled, curving brow evokes this tomb guardian's superhuman force. He stands on a bull, which implies his power, but also establishes his kinship with a deity that came to China from India with Buddhism; known as Virudhaka in Sanskrit, he is the guardian of the south. South was the most auspicious orientation for palaces as well as tombs.During the Tang dynasty, ceramic tomb figures were fired either glazed or unglazed, then painted. This example, arguably the finest of its kind, combines both techniques, and the sculpting, glazing, and painted face are all of the highest quality. The degree of detail, such as the folded fingers of his right hand, the realistic posture, and the fluttering cloth under his armor, is virtually unique. The maker's mastery of the firing process is evident in the handling of the three-colored lead glaze, which was allowed to run on the bull's flank but remains contained in the separate areas of the guardian's garment. Traces of gold on the buckles of his armor indicate that the figure was made for a person of very high status.

This dramatic pose does not appear before the Tang dynasty, which immediately preceded the brief Five Dynasties era. Long associated with good things for agriculture, including the water of wells, springs, rivers, and rain, by the Tang dynasty dragons had also come to symbolize the emperor.Carved in relief from a large block of stone, this splendid creature is architectural in scale. Traces of the original pigments are still visible: gold on the eye, red in the mouth, and blue on the body. In China, the blue dragon is associated with the east, which suggests this slab may have come from the east wall of a tomb.Transverse grooves on the underside of the dragon's upper lip reveal an influence that arrived with Buddhism, specifically, from the depiction of a mythical Indian aquatic animal called a makara. The orblike disk with sinuous projections in front of the dragon is a motif that first appeared in the Five Dynasties period and became practically ubiquitous in later art, especially on ceramics and textiles.Our Western dragons represent greed. However, the Chinese dragon is different. It represents the vitality of the swamps. . . .

These include such features as angular, sharp-faced rocks and one-sided compositions, often diagonally juxtaposing nearby objects to views into distant space.

He is the embodiment of fierce and unflagging determination. Yet it is difficult to decide whether the furrowed brows and grimacing mouth of Kyosai's figure signal firmness of will or befuddlement. The image fits into a long tradition of humorous caricature of Zen patriarchs. Determinedly rejecting superficial attractiveness or saccharine religious emotion, Zen art frequently seems iconoclastic and irreverent. Reflecting the spirit of its practitioners, Zen art emphasized getting to the heart of the matter rather than getting hung up on appearances. Kyōsai was a devout Buddhist.   Daruma Parodies ""“The founder of Zen Buddhism, known in Japan as Daruma, was represented in certain standard ways in Buddhist painting. Daruma was often pictured with a large nose, mustache, earrings, and dressed in a red monk's robe, all suggestive of his foreign origins. Parodies on the traditional representation began to appear in the seventeenth century. In color woodblock prints, Daruma might be paired with a courtesan, say, in a juxtaposition of beauty and beast, profane and sacred. The two were placed together in a variety of amusing juxtapositions: the courtesan sometimes appeared dressed in Daruma's garb, while Daruma wore her kimono. When Daruma had been parodied over and over, the ‘rules' were effectively flouted with interesting results.”Hardacre, Helen, and Adam L. Kern. New Directions in the Study of Meiji Japan. New York: Brill, 1997, p. 114.""  Portraits of Daruma ""“Daruma (Bodhidharma) is venerated as the semi-legendary founder of Zen Buddhism: Of the brahmin class of southern India, in about AD 520 he took the faith to China, where he received the patronage of the Emperor Wu Di of the Liang (AD 464-549). At Shao Lin Temple on Mt Song he sat in meditation for nine years facing a wall before passing on the Zen teaching to his pupil. Portraits of Daruma as a hirsute Indian monk of forceful mien with bushy eyebrows and rings in his long earlobes, seated in meditation wearing simple monastic robes, were a common subject done by medieval Zen monk-painters, as an object of their veneration. Often the treatment was humorous and eccentric, occasionally even irreverent. Daruma also entered the repertoire of Kan?-school artists early on: there are famous extant portraits of him by Motonobu and Tan' y?, and one by some time in 1885. The heavily modulated, flowing brushwork in the robes of the present scroll is very much in the Edo Kan? tradition, though this drapery is more windblown and the facial features more rugged than in Tan' y?'s urbane Daruma portraits of the mid-seventeenth century. There is also a slight, almost intangible measure of Western influence in the foreshortening of the eyes to account for the head being slightly turned. Another portrait by Ky?sai in similar style, but with Daruma staring out at the viewer, is in the Tiger Collection, USA.”NB: The last work discussed is either the IMA's Daruma or an exact match.Clark, Timothy.

The use of light ink washes to capture the drifting banks of mist results in a gentle lyricism. In vivid contrast to the soft, atmospheric treatment of the distant objects, dark black ink was used to outline the crystalline top of a rock and the contorted trunk of an imposing pine tree. The strength of form and the sharp, crisp strokes used for the pine needles and branches boldly and energetically anchor the composition. Tan'yû, often called the ""revitalizer of the Kanô&nbsp;school,"" was official painter to the shōgun and the foremost artist of his day.   Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection (2005) In this vast, yet intimate landscape, a scholar and his attendant in the lower left corner gaze upon a watery expanse with houses and boats on the shore, as banks of mist drift among distant mountains. The artist, Tan'yu, was head of the main branch of the Kano School and the Tokugawa shogun's official painter. Kano School painters were the principal practitioners of kanga, literally, “Chinese painting,” which blended domestic and imported Chinese painting styles. Tan'yu's brushwork, for example, owes much to the Southern Song dynasty painter Xia Gui. Favoring strongly modulated linework and a Chinese-flavored repertory of themes, Kano painters enjoyed the lucrative patronage of the samurai ruling class, and the Kano School would reign supreme for almost four hundred years, from the 16th century on.In China, landscapes had emerged as the most popular subject for painting by the year 1000. Besides the pleasure of admiring an artist's skill in capturing scenic beauty, a viewer could travel in heart and mind, if not in body, to unsullied places, gaining the benefits of walking amidst mountains and streams without leaving home. According to the 11th-century painter Guo Xi, a virtuous man nourishes his nature in rustic retreats, delighting in streams and rocks, meeting woodcutters and hermits, and watching wild animals at play.

Dated only one year prior to Hongren's death in 1663, his gigantic scroll…can be heralded as one of the artist's best works; his swansong… It is majestic, imposing, and awesome.""   Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection (2005) At nearly ten feet high, this monumental landscape is one of Hongren's largest known works. The painting invites the viewer to enter at a point between the pines in the foreground and enjoy the calm surface of the water at the foot of a majestic mass of mountains.Hongren's hometown was near Huangshan, or Yellow Mountain, one of the great, scenic mountains in China. He fled south during the Manchu invasion and returned several years later, after the turmoil of dynastic change had subsided. Like many others, he became a monk to avoid political difficulties; Hongren, the Buddhist name he took, is how he is now known.The Huangshan region was not only one of spectacular vistas, but during Hongren's time was very economically prosperous. The area's affluence nourished many artists, who depicted the mountainous landscape, often with dry, sparse brushwork. Hongren, who was acknowledged during his own time and by later critics as one of the greatest painters of the mid-1600s, is traditionally known as one of the Four Great Masters of the Xin'an district. Unlike many of his smaller works, which have a compositional simplicity, this looming, elaborate image is almost overwhelming. Created one year before Hongren's death, it has been called his swan song.People . . . regarded possession of a painting by Hongren, or the lack thereof, as determining one's refinement or vulgarity.—Scholar, official, and connoisseur Zhou Lianggong, 1612–1672   K.

Imported luxury goods—the Qing Dynasty porcelain jar from China, the lemon with spiraling peel, and the delicate Venetian glass—anchor the arrangement. The ornamented silver tray and the wine glass, seated on a gilded mount adorned with a putto clutching a cornucopia, epitomize exquisite Dutch local craft. These precious items subtly reflect the light, which transforms them into sparkling gems that rival the prized articles themselves.   Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection (2005) When Willem Kalf painted this luxurious still life, his home city of Amsterdam was the trading center of Europe. Persian textiles, tropical fruits, and Asian porcelains were just a few of the exotic commodities brought by intrepid Dutch seafarers to the bustling markets of the capital.The precious objects assembled here are carefully arranged to celebrate both the painter's skill and the enterprising spirit of Holland's golden age. On a marble tabletop, polished Dutch silver reflects the sparkle of delicate Venetian glass, while a curling lemon peel teases the senses of smell and taste. Reflections animate the glossy surface of a Chinese export porcelain jar from the 1640s. The centerpiece of the composition is a Dutch roemer, or wine glass, with an elaborate gilded mount. At its base, a cherub clutches a cornucopia, symbolizing peace and plenty, but the rumpled carpet seems to offer only a precarious support. At left, a ticking watch signals the passage of time.

The deeply carved, stylized design of peony flowers and leaves boldly fills its central section. Taut curves evoke a sense of energy contained, like a spring ready to be released. The peony was a popular motif because of its colorful, lush blossoms, and because the flower's name sounds the same as the words for wealth and honor, adding an air of auspiciousness to whatever it adorns. Called the “king of flowers,” the peony owes its popularity to the only woman to rule China as emperor—Wu Zetian, who reigned from 690 to 705. Her passion for the flower inspired its appreciation by the many officials who hoped to advance their careers under her reign.Cizhou-type ware is made of a coarse stoneware covered with a white slip, a diluted clay coating, which is then scratched or carved, exposing the darker, buff-colored body beneath. Named for the northern kiln site Cizhou, present-day Cixian, located in Hebei province, this popular, sturdy pottery was created for daily utilitarian use. Produced continuously from the 10th century to the present day, it has one of the longest histories of all the major ceramic traditions.Cizhou-type ware has been called “the people's ware” because it was made for everyday use.

Classical mythology frequently provided the inspiration for the Urbino ware's highly pictorial decoration, executed in brilliant colors. Despite their similar appearance, these plates are from different sets. The words Quando forapito Ganimed (""When Ganymede was captured"") are inscribed on the back of the plate on the left. It depicts the mortal Ganymede, being borne aloft by the eagle of Zeus to become the god's cupbearer. The unmarked plate on the right may depict a scene from the story of Apollo and his son Aesculapius. These plates were probably intended mainly for display This stand, like much Siena ware, is decorated with cornucopias, winged putti (or cherub) heads and arabesques on the front. A ewer originally accompanied this stand and was secured by the boss that protrudes from the center of the piece.

60,  vase with nine peach design  Qianlong       Currently on View in K308   Image Licensing   , Qing dynasty ,vase, porcelain with overglaze enamels , Chinese ,"       Gallery Label   Related Text   Provenance      This decoration appears realistic, but in nature, buds, blossoms, leaves and fruit never appear together. Peaches are symbols of immortality, and ""nine"" has the same sound as the word for ""a long time."" Many decorations in Chinese art are actually rebuses, or image puzzles; the images, when pronounced, had the same sound as other auspicious words or ideas.   Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection (2005) This lyrical image of a peach branch is portrayed very naturalistically, even though it shows an impossible state of affairs: peach buds, blossoms, leaves, and fruit could never appear on one branch at the same time. A magical, timeless quality arising from this simultaneity reinforces the immortality or longevity symbolized by the peach motif. One of the more popular legends concerning the peach is that of Xiwangmu, mythological Queen Mother of the West, who is said to have a peach tree that bears fruit every three thousand years. When the fruit ripens, Xiwangmu invites immortals to partake of the miraculous peach of eternal life.This large porcelain vase was made under imperial patronage, as the six-character reign mark on the bottom signifies. The design is particularly successful because the painter was sensitive to the vase's complex shape—notice how the placement on the shoulder makes the peaches more prominent. Such vases are among the most admired type of porcelain objects from this period. The quality, size, and choice of subject made this vase suitable for display in any room of the emperor's palace.Qing-dynasty artists attained an unprecedented technical skill in their handling of ceramics and glazes. In the early 1700s, they discovered that by adding a white pigment to translucent, tinted enamels they could obtain opaque colors. This allowed enamelers to work with a palette of colors similar to that used in oil painting, a medium introduced to China through contact with European missionaries and traders.   S.

67,"  Retreat at the Foot of Mt. Hui  Wang Meng (Chinese, about 1308-1385)       Not Currently on View   Image Licensing   ", Yuan dynasty ,Retreat, ink on paper ,"  Wang Meng (Chinese, about 1308-1385)  ","       Related Text   Provenance      Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection (2005) Wang Meng was one of the Four Great Masters of the Yuan dynasty, a group of painters who were renowned for their landscapes and influenced many later generations of artists. This intimate representation of a secluded dwelling at the foot of Mount Hui is an early example of a genre of “retreat” images that emerged to widespread popularity in the 1300s and that may relate to the rise of eremitism during the Yuan dynasty. Typical of Wang's style is the contrast between the scrubbed strokes and wriggling textures with which he renders nature and his calm and simple treatment of figures and architecture. Another of the Yuan masters, Ni Zan, wrote of Wang and his exuberant style, “The strength of Wang Meng's brush is able to lift a tripod. In the past five hundred years there has not been such a master.”The Yuan dynasty, when China was ruled by the Mongols and visited by Marco Polo, was a watershed moment in painting, as artists turned away from verisimilitude in favor of more personal expressions. Ever since, the duplication of visual reality has been considered less important than the statement of artistic personality. Like the choice of words in a poem, the style of brushstrokes and ink can express the qualities of what is depicted more effectively than its explicit appearance.There is one basic rule in poetry and painting - natural genius and originality.—Poet and Statesman Su Shi, 1037–1101   [Walter Hochstadter {1914-2007}]; Eli Lilly, Indianapolis ($9,500.); given to the Indianapolis Museum of Art in 1960.

Made in China at a time when the manufacture of silk tapestries had reached its pinnacle, the refinement and sophistication of this tapestry are rivaled only by the most admired paintings of the time. Pigments were used to individualize a face or other finishing elements. For the rest, the weavers used their nails, filed in a sawtooth pattern, to pack the fine silk threads into place and create an intricate image.Mounted as a hanging scroll and intended for a palatial setting, this tapestry depicts a paradisical realm, with male and female immortals inhabiting an idyllic landscape of mountains, clouds, waterfalls, pines, and willow trees. This was a very popular subject in China, and one that was historically associated with the pursuit of physical immortality.Here, the Eighteen Buddhist disciples on scrolling clouds hold auspicious attributes. Other immortals examine a scroll, discuss poetry and literature, and play the board game qi (go)—a favorite pastime. In the foreground, two groups enjoy a leisurely stroll along the riverbank, where two cranes, Chinese symbols of longevity, stand.

Like many before him, C. C. Wang believed that the appreciation and connoisseurship of Chinese painting depended on two factors: being an artist who knew how to use a brush and having a broad knowledge and understanding of past masters. C. C. Wang began studying painting in Suzhou, Jiangsu, a city famous for its wonderful gardens. He moved to Shanghai and continued his studies, but more importantly, he became knowledgeable about the history of art by examining great paintings in both private collections and the Palace Museum. After leaving China in 1947, Wang settled in New York City, a center for western and modern art. Wang found similarities between abstract expressionism and Chinese painting, which centuries ago had discarded representational likeness in favor of spiritual expression. He referred to his landscapes as ""mountains of the mind"" and ""mind landscapes.""
