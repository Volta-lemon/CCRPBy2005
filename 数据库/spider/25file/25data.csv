The iconography is based on that of the historical Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama. The elongated earlobes reference the heavy earrings worn by the prince before he renounced his worldly wealth; the protrusion atop his head is called ushnisha, and it signifies enlightenment. Other physical traits include the “all-seeing” third eye, or urna, at the forehead, the three fleshy rings of the neck indicating the three states of existence, and the monk’s robe, or uttarasanga, which shows his religious devotion. The Wheel of Law symbols on the soles of Vairocana’s feet are reminders of the teachings of the Eight-Fold Path, which the Buddha and his followers practice to attain Nirvana.

Although herons can be seen throughout Japan, they became a popular subject for Japanese ink paintings beginning in the Muromachi period (1392–1568) because of the influence of imported Chinese works. The characters for heron and fortune do not share the same pronunciation in Japanese, so the auspicious connotation of the birds was not emphasized in Japan. Yukinobu is known for her delicate and charming paintings, and she is one of the most important female artists of the Edo period (1600–1868).   Mr. and Mrs. James W.

The fish are shown from an unusual vantage point, as if the viewer were underwater too, or as if the jar itself were transparent. A rich variety of meanings is associated with the motif, which has a long history in ceramic decoration. One of the better-known associations is the exchange between two 4th-century BCE Daoist philosophers, Zhuangzi and Huizi. Zhuangzi observed: “See how the fish swim as they please. That's what fish really enjoy.” When Huizi asked, “How do you know what fish enjoy?” Zhuangzi replied, “You're not I, so how do you know I don't know what fish enjoy?”The Ming dynasty witnessed the development of enamel overglaze decoration in a palette of brilliant colors, produced by multiple firings. In the first stage, a cobalt-based paint was applied beneath a clear glaze; when the piece was fired, bright blue designs emerged against the white porcelain. Translucent enamels were then applied over the glaze, and the work was fired a second time. Made in the imperial kilns, this covered vessel is one of the few large, similarly decorated jars that demonstrate mastery of this complex technique. It would have endowed its owner with great prestige.Fish have several popular associations derived from literature, including abundance, pleasure, royalty, and success.

Made in China at a time when the manufacture of silk tapestries had reached its pinnacle, the refinement and sophistication of this tapestry are rivaled only by the most admired paintings of the time. Pigments were used to individualize a face or other finishing elements. For the rest, the weavers used their nails, filed in a sawtooth pattern, to pack the fine silk threads into place and create an intricate image.Mounted as a hanging scroll and intended for a palatial setting, this tapestry depicts a paradisical realm, with male and female immortals inhabiting an idyllic landscape of mountains, clouds, waterfalls, pines, and willow trees. This was a very popular subject in China, and one that was historically associated with the pursuit of physical immortality.Here, the Eighteen Buddhist disciples on scrolling clouds hold auspicious attributes. Other immortals examine a scroll, discuss poetry and literature, and play the board game qi (go)—a favorite pastime. In the foreground, two groups enjoy a leisurely stroll along the riverbank, where two cranes, Chinese symbols of longevity, stand.

Artists of different time periods use established motifs or recreate them in different ways.  The ancient bronze has bands with spiral and eye motifs; the later cloisonné depicts a face in a colorful, decorative manner; and the more recent nephrite vessel uses less detail in its bands of décor. Different materials, different times: An object's design encodes its time; think of how automobiles have changed over time. Eggshell-thin ceramic vessels with polished surfaces appeared at the end of the Neolithic period. In the ensuing Bronze Age (middle example), metal was the preferred choice for ritual chalices.Â  The later blue vase recalls past shapes, but glaze color takes center stage, allowing designs-a possible distraction to the appreciation of color-to be omitted.

173,  coiled dragon  Qing dynasty       Not Currently on View   Image Licensing   , Qing dynasty ,coiled, nephrite , Chinese ,"       Related Text   Provenance      Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection (2005) This object is a particularly inventive sculptural conception that departs from the elongated, wingless dragon of Chinese tradition—the tightly wound mythical beast coils back upon itself like a swan at rest. The sculptor probably derived the compact composition from the shape of the nephrite rock from which it was made, and cleverly incorporated the discoloration produced by weathering into the object's design.Neither photography nor gallery display can do justice to this tiny dragon, for it can only be appreciated by handling and seeing it on all sides. Nephrite—the Chinese word translated as “jade” means “beautiful stone”—is harder than steel and cannot be carved, but must be ground or drilled using a slurry of abrasive materials, such as fine grains of quartz or jade filings. The grinding process, which is relatively easy on planes, is extremely difficult on curved surfaces. Inferior polishing leaves many small, flat sections, all of which can be seen under unforgiving light, but the surface of this dragon is impeccable. This small work of art may have served as a paperweight and would have brought enjoyment to anyone who had the opportunity to hold it. In 1971, R. Norris Shreve, chairman of the School of Engineering at Purdue University, and his wife, Irene, gave the Museum more than 350 items, mostly of jade. Their generous gifts formed the core of the IMA's collection of later Chinese jades.Ancient tradition ascribed nine virtues to jade: benevolence, wisdom, righteousness, proper conduct, purity, courage, refinement, tolerance, and gentleness.

A popular legend describes how after the Buddha’s passing and cremation, a demon grabbed a tooth from among the Buddha’s ashes and fled in an instant more than 300,000 miles. In a single leap Idaten stopped him and regained the relic. In Japanese, to “run like Idaten” (Idaten-bashiri) is to be speedy.

Both were poetically inspired by the lines and shapes he perceived in nature, and he referred to his sculptures as “drawings in space.” He drew constantly, as the image of his living room below shows, because drawing was more fast-moving in comparison to the time-consuming and physical nature of making sculpture. To capture his constant work stream, he titled each drawing with month, day, and year, sometimes adding the Greek letters Δ (Delta) Σ (Sigma) to stand in for his initials DS. His drawings were mostly executed with egg yolks and Chinese inks, using a brush, to give his lines mass and volume. He worked out his thoughts in drawings, but rarely is there a one-to-one relationship of a drawing to a sculpture.
